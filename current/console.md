## Console commands
Rejoice ships with useful console features to allow you test quickly your application and other more.

The console application in Rejoice is name `smile`.

## Running the simulator
You have access to two simulators, one in console, the other as a web interface.
You can provide the configuration of the simulator in the .env file:

### Console simulator

Run the console simulator by running the command
```php
php smile simulator:console
```
You can use the shortcut `php smile sim:con`
> Note: You can use shortcuts for any simulator command, provided it does not conflict with any other command.

### Web simulator

Run the console simulator by running the command
```php
php smile simulator:web
```

## Create a new menu
### Directly in the Menus folder
```php
php smile menu:new MyMenu
```

Will create the class `MyMenu` in a newly created `app/Menus/MyMenu.php`.

### In a Menu sub-folder
```php
php smile menu:new FirstFlow/MyMenu
```

Will create the class `MyMenu` in a newly created `app/Menus/FirstFlow/MyMenu.php`.
If the sub-folder does not exist, it will be created.
